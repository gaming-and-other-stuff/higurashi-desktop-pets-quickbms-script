# higurashi-desktop-pets-quickbms-script
A QuickBMS script for the Higurashi Desktop Pets.

## Ownership
I did not make this script, I requested for this script to be made sometime in mid 2022. I did not manage to document who gave me this script or even remember who made it, so I unfortunately can't credit the original author.

## Usage
This script is to be used with QuickBMS and the [Higurashi Desktop Pets programs](https://archive.org/details/higurashi-desktop-pets). To use it, drag and drop the script to QuickBMS, then open the .pac file from one of the desktop pets, then select an output folder.
